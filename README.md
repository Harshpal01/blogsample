### How does the web work 
works by connecting clients (browsers) and servers over the
internet, using requests and responses to deliver web pages and 
applications 

frontend (interface (HTML, CSS, JS))
Middlewares (intermediaries between the frontend and backend(API's , web services))
Backend (server side (databases, server scripting files to process requests from the client))

### HTML (hyper text mark up language)
1. HTML ELEMENTS : creation of structures of a page 
   Types of elements: 
     a. Block Level elements : occupies the entire row section  i.e. <p> , <div> , <section>
     b. Inline elements : occupy what the element requires i.e. <a> <img>

Syntax 
<> content </>


### CSS (Cascading style sheets)
1. Styles out of html elements 
2. Responsiveness / Layouts 

When writing CSS we have 3 modes of styling HTML elements using CSS 
a. Inline styling = use of style attribute to include our css styling 
b. Internal styling = use of style element in the head section to write our CSS 
c. External styling = link our html to an external css file.

Syntax 
selector {
    property : value
}

selector specificity {
    property : value
}

The main selectors when using css are as follows
a. id attribute : identification -> to identify the element to be styled 
b. class attribute : group stylings to be implemented to a group of elements with 
the same class name. 
c. tag selector : when you stipulate the html element to style in CSS , any element without an id or a class attribute will receive the same styling 


### HTML SEMANTICS 
HTML Semantics clearly describe the meaning and role to both 
browsers and developers 
 #### Why ? 
 - Improves SEO  (search engine optimization)
 - Code Readablity 

 <div> place html </div> 


 Tag	     Purpose
<header>	Represents the page header or section header
<nav>	    Contains navigation links
<main>	    Main content of the page (only one per page)
<section>	A section of content (with a heading)
<article>	An independent piece of content (e.g., blog post)
<aside>	    Side content, like ads or a sidebar
<footer>	Bottom part of the page, often for copyright & links
<figure> & <figcaption>	Groups an image with a caption
<mark>	    Highlights text for importance
<time>	    Represents a date or time


### CSS POSITIONING VALUES 
1. static (default) :: the default position of elements. They follow the normal document flow 
2. relative :: moves an element relative to its normal position 
3. absolute :: the element is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relatively to the nearest element/ ancestor 
4. fixed :: the element stays in position even on scrolling 
5. sticky :: the element acts like its in a relative position until scrolled past then it sticks.

- Margin : creates margins between elements
- Padding:  space inside the element between its content and border 

### CSS GRID SYSTEM 
### KEY CONCEPTS IN THE GRID SYSTEM 
1. grid-container : the parent element where the grid is defined : display : grid;
2. grid-items : the child inside the grid container / partions of my page 
3. grid areas : a group of grid items that define the partions 
5. grid-template-columns : define column sizes 
6. grid-template-rows : define row sizes 
7. grid-template-areas : define named regions in the grid 


                           navbar
menu A                     menu B                       menu C 
                           form 
        video 1                                       video2
                           footer


### FUNDAMENTALS OF PROGRAMMING 
Programming is a process of writing instructions for a computer to execute 
These instructions are written via programming languages like JS, Python, Java , C++ 

#### Key Concepts 
1. Algorithms and Logic writing 
2. Variables and Data Types 
3. Control Structures (Flow of Execution)
    a/ conditional statements 
    b/ loops
4. Functions 
5. OOP (Object Oriented Programming) / DOM 
6. Error handling and Debugging 


### JAVASCRIPT 
1. Dynamic : no need to specify the data type 
2. Interpreted : runs directly in browsers without compilation 
3. Event-Driven : responds to user actions 
4. Versatile : Works on both front end and backend(nodeJS)

function nameoffunction(){
    <!-- logic function -->
}


### VARIABLES 
variables store data (what is the data types?)

- Declaring variables 
  a. var (old way , function-scoped)
  b. let (modern, block-scoped) : mutable : allowing change 
  c. const (constant , variable cannot be reassigned)

- Scope refers to the accessibility of the variable 


### JAVASCRIPT SCOPE : understanding a variable visibility and lifetime 
 scopes determine the visibility of your variables / functions / objects in different parts of 
 your code 

#### 4 types of scope 
1. Global scope 
2. Local/Function scope 
3. Block Scope 
4. Lexical (closure scope)

#### Conditional statements 
conditional statements allow us to control the flow of programs based of conditions 

1. if statement (else if and else )
